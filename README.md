# Hi, I’m Akshit 👋

I design, prototype, and ship product experiences that bridge design, engineering, and emerging technology.

Most of my work is hands-on: real products, high-fidelity prototypes, and production-ready systems across XR, AI-powered platforms, and interactive applications. I specialize in turning complex systems into usable, scalable, and measurable experiences.

I work on end-to-end product development — from research and interaction design to UX engineering and front-end collaboration — ensuring ideas move cleanly from concept to launch.
